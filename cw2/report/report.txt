Advanced Web Tech Coursework 2 - Report

Introduction

The web app that has been developed for the coursework is an online pizza
ordering website made with python flask.

The website has a search box that would let you know if your postcode is
delivered to (but it doesn't work). It has an order page where you can view the
pizzas that are sold. When clicking on "buy now" you are taken to a page that
shows which pizza you have chosen. There is a login page, when the user logs in
a session is created and they can access a secret members page, if the session
is not set then they cannot access this page.


Design

The web app is structured with a main .py file, a static folder for css, an etc
folder for the config file, a templates folder for the html pages and a var
folder for databasse and log files.

The website has an index, an order page, a login page, an account page, a page
for each pizza and a 404 page.


Enhancements

Due to not knowing how, the website doesn't actually ask for a payment. If I
knew how to I would redirect the user to PayPal to make their payment. I
would've also liked to have included bootstrap and encryption.


Evaluation

I feel the website is alright, but it could be improved upon greatly. I spent
too much time working on things that I could not get to work.


Personal Evaluation

I feel like I have learned a lot from this. I have learned how to use sqlite, I
understand what logging is used for and I have a better understanding of python
flask in general.
